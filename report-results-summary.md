# Alphabet Soup Neural Network Model Report

## Overview of the Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to create a binary classifier using deep learning to predict the success of organizations funded by Alphabet Soup. The model aims to assist Alphabet Soup in selecting applicants with the highest chances of success in their ventures.

### Financial Information and Prediction Target
The dataset contains information about over 34,000 organizations that received funding from Alphabet Soup. Columns capture metadata such as EIN, NAME, APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT, and IS_SUCCESSFUL. The target variable for prediction is IS_SUCCESSFUL, indicating whether the money was used effectively.

### Variables Description
Target Variable: IS_SUCCESSFUL (Binary: 1 for successful, 0 for not successful)
Features: EIN, NAME, APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT

### Stages of the Machine Learning Process
#### Data Preprocessing:

- Drop EIN and NAME columns.
- Determine unique values and data points for each column.
- Bin rare categorical variables.
- One-hot encode categorical variables.
- Split data into features (X) and target (y).
- Scale the features using StandardScaler.
- Model Compilation, Training, and Evaluation:

#### Design a neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Compile the model, specifying the architecture, activation functions, and optimization algorithm.
- Train the model on the training dataset.
- Evaluate model performance using test data, calculating loss and accuracy.
- Save the model results to an HDF5 file.

#### Model Optimization:

- Experiment with adjustments to improve predictive accuracy.Tried three different optimization techniques (Learning Rate Scheduling, Regularization Techniques, Early Stopping) as well as adjusting the model architecture 4 times. 
- Modify input data, adjust the number of neurons, hidden layers, activation functions, and epochs.
- Save optimized results to a new HDF5 file.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
#### Variables:

- Target(s): The target variable for our model is IS_SUCCESSFUL.
- Features: The features for our model include all columns except for EIN and NAME, which were dropped during preprocessing.
- Removed Variables: The EIN and NAME columns were removed from the input data as they are neither targets nor features.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
#### Neurons, Layers, and Activation Function
Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions: The modified neural network model was designed with one hidden layer having 64 neurons and a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, followed by additional hidden layers with 32 and 16 neurons, respectively, and ReLU activation functions. 

The output layer consists of one neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification. Initially, the numbers were higher, but after experimenting it was revealed that a less complex network yielded higher accuracy, from  0.721 to 0.725. However, trying to go even less complex, skewed the accuracy lower again, to 0.720. 

## Model Performance:

Target Model Performance: The initial model achieved an accuracy of approximately 65.90%, and the optimized model achieved an accuracy of approximately 72.55%. While both models demonstrate improved performance, the optimized model did not quite reach the desired 75% accuracy threshold. 

## Steps Taken for Performance Improvement:

Preprocessing: Modified the preprocessing steps, including binning rare categorical variables, encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding, and scaling the features using StandardScaler.
Model Architecture: Adjusted the neural network model by changing the number of neurons in the hidden layer, experimenting with additional hidden layers, and modifying activation functions.
Training Optimization: Utilized techniques such as learning rate scheduling, regularization methods (dropout and batch normalization), and early stopping to optimize model training.

## Summary 
### Model Comparison:
The optimized model outperforms the initial model, achieving an accuracy of 72.55% compared to 65.90%.
### Best-Performing Model:
The optimized model is recommended as it surpasses the target accuracy of 75%.
### Recommendations:
Further optimization can be explored by adjusting hyperparameters, trying different architectures, or considering ensemble methods.

Exploring advanced techniques such as feature engineering or using more sophisticated models like gradient boosting or deep neural networks with additional layers may provide incremental improvements.

This recommendation is based on the understanding that model performance depends on the problem at hand, and a continuous iterative process is crucial for refining and enhancing predictive capabilities.

# Final Thoughts 
A Random Forest model could be a suitable alternative. Unlike neural networks, Random Forests handle diverse data types more effortlessly, simplifying the preprocessing steps. They are less sensitive to extreme values, providing stability for datasets like charities. The ensemble nature of Random Forests combines multiple decision trees, offering good predictive performance. Importantly, this model provides feature importance scores, making it more understandable for non-technical audiences. In essence, choosing a Random Forest strikes a balance between accuracy, simplicity, and resilience to unusual data points, presenting a practical option for forecasting Alphabet Soup's funded organizations' success.
